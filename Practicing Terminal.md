# A preif about my knowledge in terminal. 
A command line, or terminal, is a text prompt, you can enter commands on, and the system will execute these commands.
It is the proffesional way to deal with your system as a programer.
You can do anything in terminal such as : 


     -creating directory {mkdir}
     -delete directory{rmdir}
     -iterate between your directories and alter them as you want{cd (the directory name)}
     -see the files that the directory contains {ls}
     -step back on directory {cd ..}
     -create a blank file {touch}
     -copy the file or directory {cp}
     -and a lot more ,,,
