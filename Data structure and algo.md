# Introduction 
I think that the data structure that we are using in our programs is the most important part of the app, because it defines how the data are being moved and iterated 
in our program, and here comes the role of Algorithims, it is a a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation, and this procedure is applied on
our data structure.
## The most important data structures that every programmer should know : 

   - **Arrays**
   - **Linked list**
   - **Stacks**
   - **Queues**
   - **Hash tables**
   - **Trees**
   - **Heaps**
   - **Graphs**


### My ideas about using data structure 
 *How to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?*
 
 
 
 We have to make consideration about what are the operations and the data flow that is going to be performed and how they are going to be executed.
 
 
 
*How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?*

We have to know our base case before calling any recursion function, and we put it as condition in the recursion function, then when the program reaches this base case
it will get out of the recursion function and give us the result we want from that function.



### Things I want to know more about
I think i am still weak in algorithims, so i want to know more about algo and implement some.
