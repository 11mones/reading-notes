 # Stacks and Queues
## Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It can be thought of as a stack of plates, where the last plate added is the first one to be removed.

## Key characteristics:
1. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.
2. The most recently added element is always at the top.
3. The least recently added element is at the bottom.



**Operations:**
     push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
     
     
     
     pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
     
     
     
     
     peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
     
     
     
     
     
     isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
    
    
    
**Common use cases:**
Function call stack.





Expression evaluation and syntax parsing.





Undo/Redo functionality in text editors.





Backtracking algorithms.





## Queues
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It can be visualized as people waiting in a line, where the person who arrives first is served first.

## Key characteristics:
1. Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue.
2. The least recently added element is always at the front.
3. The most recently added element is at the rear.



**Operations:**
enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.




dequeue: Removes the front element from the queue.




front: Returns the front element without removing it.





rear: Returns the rear element without removing it.




isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.






**Common use cases:**




Task scheduling.




Print spooling.





Message queues.





Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.
