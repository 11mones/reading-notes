#  Key components of the Django framework


* Models: Define the data structure and handle interactions with the database.
* Views: Handle requests, process data, and generate responses.
* Templates: Render dynamic HTML output for the views.
* URLs: Map URLs to corresponding views.
* Forms: Simplify handling of HTML forms and data validation.
* Middleware: Perform operations on requests and responses.
* Admin Interface: Built-in interface for managing application data.


**These components work together to simplify and accelerate web application development in Django.**



# MTV (Model-View-Template):

**Model:**

Models represent the data structure and business logic of the application.


They interact with the database, handle data validation, and perform CRUD operations.


Models define the data schema, relationships between entities, and behavior of data objects.


**View:**

Views handle the logic behind processing a client's request and generating a response.


When a URL is requested, the associated view function or class is invoked.


Views fetch necessary data from the models, perform any required processing, and prepare the data for rendering.


**Template:**


Templates are responsible for generating the final presentation layer of the response.


They combine the received data from the view with the HTML structure to create the output.


Django's template engine allows embedding Python-like code (Django Template Language) to enable dynamic rendering and logic within templates.


# Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined classes for styling and structuring UI elements, giving developers
granular control over the design. Bootstrap CSS, on the other hand, offers pre-built components and a grid system for faster development with
a predefined visual style. Tailwind CSS focuses on customization and flexibility, while Bootstrap CSS emphasizes ready-to-use components and
a consistent look and feel.

**In other words, the powerness of tailwind is the term of customization.**
