# Serverless Functions

**Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and dynamically allocates computing resources.**



It is characterized by managed infrastructure, event-driven execution, automatic scaling, pay-per-use billing, stateless execution, and rapid deployment and 
development. Serverless differs from traditional server-based architectures by eliminating the need for infrastructure management, enabling automatic scaling 
based on demand, providing cost efficiency through pay-per-use pricing, facilitating faster time-to-market, and increasing resilience. However, it also has
considerations such as cold start latency and potential vendor lock-in. Overall, serverless computing offers benefits in terms of reduced operational overhead,
improved scalability, cost efficiency, faster time-to-market, and increased resilience.


## Getting started with vercel


**To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function:**

* Sign up for a Vercel account.
* Install the Vercel CLI tool.
* Initialize your project using vercel init.
* Write your serverless function code.
* Test the function locally using vercel dev.
* Deploy the function with vercel.
* Customize deployment settings and environment variables.
* Access the deployed function using the provided URL.
* Configure additional settings through the Vercel dashboard or vercel.json.



**Vercel simplifies serverless function deployment with easy integration, scaling, CI/CD, and a user-friendly interface.**


## API
**APIs are rules and protocols that allow software applications to communicate. In Python, APIs are used to access and manipulate data from external sources.**



The steps involved in utilizing APIs in Python applications are: import libraries, obtain API credentials, make HTTP requests, handle API responses,
handle errors, manipulate data, and implement rate limiting and caching. Python libraries like requests and Flask simplify API integration and data retrieval.






## Requests library in Python



**The Requests library in Python is used for making HTTP requests to interact with APIs.**


It provides a simple and convenient way to send requests and handle responses.

in code :


    import requests

    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users')

    if response.ok:
        data = response.json()
        # Process the retrieved data
        print(data)
    else:
        print('Error:', response.status_code)
