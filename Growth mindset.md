# The Growth mindset definition 
 The believing in people that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.
 
 
 
 This means that we can change our mindsets, and develop ourselves more and more, we just have to practice on our way of thinking of things, and these ways and our
 look through things will change and it will became wiser.
 
 
 
 ## Ways to develop our mindsets : 
 There is many things could help the one for that, maybe i see the biggest one is books, it is the old way of seeking for information in internet era, but in these things
 i think the one should do some effort and go library and buy the book and grap it in his hand and read it, instead of reading it online on internet, ofcourse we can access
 this information on internet and read it, but using books it will be better.
