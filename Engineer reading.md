# Engineer reading
Firstly, being featured in your feild opens you some doors that other people in your field stuck in, in our field (IT) the most important thing to do is to keep on track with
the upcoming technlogoies that appears every day almost, and other important thing is that you must have knowledge not just in your specific field in IT, no you have 
to know in almost all IT branches, even if it is a small knowledge.


## What to do when you are stuck ?
Everyone at some point stuck at something in programming, but you has to have a fixed procedure that you will follow each time you stucked in something, for me i think
that the commuinities of IT developers is viral and there is a lot of them, so you may ask those people that in your field and share knowledge.


The other soloution is simply Google serach, we are now in era that every information that you want is availaible for you if you seached about, so just search about it and 
read a lot.
