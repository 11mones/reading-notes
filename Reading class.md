# Introduction 
Why this topic is so important? 



The answer simply because this topic is about letting the one of us take a good look at what is he doing right now by talking this course, and know his goals and aims
and also know what is he going to sacrifies to achieve these goals. 


## Pain and suffering
There is a huge difference between pain and suffering, suffering means that the one is not feeling ok and miserable but with no goal in the end, it is just a bad thing
comes to humans, but pain is different, in pain you are not feeling ok at all but in the end there is a target you are getting in pain to reach it.



### About learning python 
Of course we all as a begginers at some point will be stuck at somethings and facing some challenges in python, the way to face these challenges is to keep on track and
read a lot and a lot and alot about python development and keep asking your teachers in course to get the information that you want to know.




## Beginners Guide to Big O 
### The Def (it is quoted)
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm, and it describes the worst case scenario.



**Here is examples about Big O notation**


  **-O(1)**, and that is the best one, it means that the program will iterate just once to be executed.
  
  
  
  
  **-O(N)**, here the things getting slower, the program will iterate (n) times to be executed.
  
  
  
  
  **-O(N^2)**, it gets even slower , it means that the program will iterate (n*n) times to be executed.
  
  
  
  
  
  **-O(2^N)**, this one is not acceptable at all, the complexity here is very very high for the program.
  
  
  
  
  ## In python, difference between mutable and immutable data types.
An object that allows you to change its values without changing its identity is a mutable object.



The changes that you can perform on a mutable object’s value are known as mutations.




In contrast, an object that doesn’t allow changes in its value is an immutable object.
