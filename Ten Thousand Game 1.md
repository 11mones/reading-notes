## Risk analysis : 
Risk analysis is the process of identifying and analyzing potential issues that could negatively impact key business initiatives or projects. This process is done in order to help organizations avoid or mitigate those risks.

Performing a risk analysis includes considering the possibility of adverse events caused by either natural processes, like severe storms, earthquakes or floods, or adverse events caused by malicious or inadvertent human activities. An important part of risk analysis is identifying the potential for harm from these events, as well as the likelihood that they will occur.





## Test coverage
**Definition :** It quantifies how much of the features being tested are covered by the test, which can be a good indicator of risk

## Big(O) notation
**Definition :** It is the notation that determine how many times our code lines will be executed to finally run the whole application for us.



**A real-life Example is** : When we wanna make cup of coffee in the morning, we can count our steps and all the things that we are doing and notate is a Big(O).
