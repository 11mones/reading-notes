# Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries 

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are popular Python visualization libraries with distinct features and use cases:

*Matplotlib: Widely used, offers extensive customization, supports various plot types, suitable for static visualizations.

**Example:** Line chart showing stock price trends.


*Seaborn: Built on Matplotlib, simplifies statistical visualizations, provides ready-to-use themes and color palettes. 


**Example:** Box plot comparing distributions across categories.


*Bokeh: Creates interactive visualizations for web browsers, supports multiple plot types, ideal for data exploration.


**Example:** Interactive scatter plot with tooltips.


**Matplotlib for customization, Seaborn for statistical visualizations, and Bokeh for interactivity.**

    
# Main functions of Seaborn library



Seaborn is a Python library for data visualization. It provides several main functions for creating different types of plots.



Relational plots, such as scatterplots, are used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.
They help identify patterns or correlations in the data.





Categorical plots, including barplots, countplots, and boxplots, are useful for analyzing data across different categories.
They provide insights into the distribution, averages, and variations within each category.




Distribution plots, such as histplots, kdeplots, and rugplots, allow visualizing the distribution of a univariate dataset.
They help understand the underlying patterns and shape of the data.




Each type of plot serves a specific purpose in data visualization, enabling users to explore and understand different aspects of their datasets.
Seaborn provides a wide range of options for creating visually appealing and informative plots.
