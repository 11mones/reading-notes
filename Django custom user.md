# Django Custom User Model 

### What is Django Custom User Model?

**A Django Custom User Model is a user model in Django that you can create by subclassing the built-in AbstractBaseUser or AbstractUser
class provided by Django. It allows you to customize and extend the default user model provided by Django to fit your application's
specific requirements.**




### Benefits compared to the default Django User Model:

* Flexibility: With a Custom User Model, you have full control over the fields and attributes of the user model. You can add, remove, or modify fields as per your application's requirements.

* Extensibility: Custom User Model allows you to easily extend the user model by adding additional fields, methods, or behaviors specific to your application. This flexibility is especially useful when you need to store additional user-related information beyond the default fields provided by Django's User Model.

* Maintainability: By using a Custom User Model, you can ensure that your user-related logic and data are encapsulated within a single model. This simplifies code maintenance and improves the overall organization of your project.

* Compatibility: Custom User Model provides better compatibility when integrating with third-party applications or libraries that expect a custom user model. It allows seamless integration without the need for complex workarounds or modifications to the default user model.

* Authentication: Custom User Model allows you to define custom authentication methods and behaviors specific to your application. You can implement alternative authentication methods such as email-based authentication or social login, providing a more user-friendly experience.

#  Implementing a Custom User Model



**To create and implement a Custom User Model in Django:**

* Create a new Django app for the custom user model.

* In the app's models.py file, define the custom user model by extending AbstractBaseUser and PermissionsMixin. Add the desired fields to the model (e.g., email, username, etc.).

* Create a custom user manager class by extending BaseUserManager. Implement methods such as create_user() and create_superuser() to create and save user instances.

* In your project's settings.py, set the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting to point to your custom user model.

* Generate and apply database migrations for the app to create the custom user model table in the database.

* Update your code to use the custom user model instead of the default Django User model. This includes updating foreign key relationships, authentication views, forms, and serializers.

**By following these steps, you will have created and implemented a Custom User Model in Django, allowing you to customize the user model
and use it throughout your application.**
